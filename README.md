##  Code Conventions

* **Class Name** starts with *uppercase* and every new word is *capitalized*
  i.e *`Vertex, NewClass, ...`*.
* **Function Name** starts with *lowercase* and every new word is *capitalized*
  i.e *`foo, fooName, ...`*.
* **Comments:** You must write a **description** before defining a *Class* or
  a *Function*.
* **For Allah** You have to write a *comment line* before every line of code
  you write.
* We use **Spaces** not **Tabs**, `1Tab = 4Spaces`.
* Always write a *multi-line comment* to test you code.
* A line **Must not** be more than 80 column.


## Fucntion example:
```java
/**
 * Describe what fooWord() does.
 * Describe the arguments.
 * Preconditions.
 * PostConditions.
**/
public void firstSecond ( argu1, argu2, ... ) {

    // What does the next line do.
    int x = 1 + 2
    .
    .
    .
} // end fooWord()
```
    
## Class example:
```java
/**
 * Describe the class
 * Tell about any 
 * ...
 * etc
**/
public class myClass {


} // end class myClass
```

* Any control statment `if, while, for, ...` follows this pattern (Multi-comment before it, comment after the end curly brace, comment before any line)


> This helps everyone to read and maintain the code **even when you're maintaining someone else code**
